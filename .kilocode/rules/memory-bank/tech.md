# Technology Stack: Pyrl Authentication System

## Programming Language
- Pyrl: Custom programming language for authentication logic
- Python: Used for virtual machine implementation (pyrl_vm.py)

## Runtime Environment
- Docker container for consistent execution environment
- Python 3.x runtime for Pyrl virtual machine

## Key Technologies
- Hash tables for user and session storage
- Regular expressions for password validation
- Session management for user authentication tracking

## Testing Framework
- Built-in test functionality within Pyrl
- Test cases for authentication flows
- Assertion-based testing for verification

## Virtual Machine
- pyrl_vm.py: Python implementation of Pyrl interpreter
- Handles execution of Pyrl authentication application
- Manages memory and variable storage
